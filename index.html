            Mariana Rosario de la Texera, is my full name. My country has the tendency to add our fathers plus our mothers last names, which is why a lot of us have long names. I was born in the very small and remote town called Aibonito in Puerto Rico on a rainy Friday July 13th. I lived in that cute looking town for 17 years until I moved to the capital of San Juan where I did my studies in Political Science and persued my main career: Professional Dancer, which I happilly did for 17 years.<br>
            As we dancers know, the dancing career is short...very short. The stamina that the body requires for dancing goes quickly. Thats when I started looking for other career options and in my search I ended up very inerested in technology. So here I am, currently in Colordao, learning about this interesting field and the University of Denver on a bootcamp. Lets see what happens.
